title: üêõ Fix static file MIME type issues in web server
description: |
  Fixed static file handler to serve CSS and JavaScript files with correct MIME types instead of text/plain.
  
  Changes:
  - Added explicit MIME type detection for common file extensions
  - Set application/javascript for .js files
  - Set text/css for .css files  
  - Added security check for directory traversal
  - Added caching headers for better performance
  
  This resolves browser errors where CSS/JS files were blocked due to MIME type mismatch.
