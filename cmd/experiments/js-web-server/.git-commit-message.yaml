title: üêõ Fix static file MIME type and path handling issues
description: |
  Fixed static file handler to properly serve embedded CSS and JavaScript files with correct MIME types.
  
  Changes:
  - Rewrote static handler to properly handle embedded filesystem paths
  - Fixed path stripping logic (static/ prefix handling) 
  - Set application/javascript for .js files (was text/plain)
  - Set text/css for .css files (was text/plain)
  - Added proper file existence checking in embedded FS
  - Added security check for directory traversal
  - Added caching headers for better performance
  - Added debug logging for troubleshooting
  
  This resolves browser MIME type mismatch errors that prevented the JavaScript playground from loading properly.
