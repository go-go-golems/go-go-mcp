# Scholarly Implementation Summary

## What we've built

1. **API Server Command**: Added a `serve` command to the Scholarly CLI that starts an HTTP server providing RESTful API endpoints for the scholarly search functionality.

2. **REST API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/search` - Search for papers across multiple sources
   - `/api/sources` - List available sources
   - `/api/health` - API health check

3. **Modern React Frontend**:
   - User-friendly interface for searching academic papers
   - Advanced filtering and sorting options
   - Clean display of paper results with links to sources
   - Built with React, TypeScript, TanStack Query, and Bootstrap

4. **Integration between API and UI**:
   - Frontend communicates with the API via Axios
   - API server configured to serve the frontend static files
   - Developer workflow with combined start script

## Architecture

The system follows a modern architecture with clean separation of concerns:

- **Backend**: Go-based API server using the Cobra command framework
- **Frontend**: React SPA with TypeScript and component-based architecture
- **API Communication**: RESTful API with JSON responses

## Key Features

- **Cross-Source Search**: Unified search across ArXiv, Crossref, and OpenAlex
- **Advanced Filtering**: Author, title, year range, category, and more
- **Result Reranking**: Uses a neural reranker to improve result relevance
- **CORS Support**: Configurable CORS settings for API access
- **Static File Serving**: API server serves the built frontend files

## Development & Production Workflow

- **Development**: Combined start script for running both API and UI
- **Production**: Build frontend and serve through the API server
- **Documentation**: API documentation and README files

## Future Improvements

- User authentication and saved searches
- Citation export functionality
- Improved mobile responsive design
- Result caching for improved performance
- Integration with additional academic sources
