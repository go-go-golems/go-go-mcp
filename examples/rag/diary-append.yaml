short: Append a diary entry with timestamp to /tmp/DIARY
long: |
  This command appends a diary entry to /tmp/DIARY, automatically formatting it as markdown
  with the current date as a heading. It's useful for maintaining a simple timestamped log
  or diary of events, thoughts, or notes.
  
  INPUT: A message to append to the diary
  OUTPUT: The message is appended to /tmp/DIARY with proper markdown formatting
  
  The command:
  - Creates /tmp/DIARY if it doesn't exist
  - Adds current date as a level 2 heading
  - Formats the message as markdown text
  - Adds two newlines after each entry for readability
  
  Common use cases:
  1. Log a quick thought: --message "Need to remember to check the logs"
  2. Record a decision: --message "Decided to use PostgreSQL for the project"
  3. Keep track of tasks: --message "- [ ] Review PR #123\n- [ ] Update documentation"
