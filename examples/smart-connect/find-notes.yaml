      Short hypothetical notes predicted to be semantically similar to the
      notes necessary to fulfill the user's request.
      
      At least three hypotheticals per request.

      The hypothetical notes may contain paragraphs, lists, or
      checklists in markdown format. Hypothetical notes always begin with
      breadcrumbs containing the anticipated folder(s), file name, and relevant
      headings separated by ' > ' (no slashes). Example: PARENT FOLDER NAME >
      CHILD FOLDER NAME > FILE NAME > HEADING 1 > HEADING 2 > HEADING 3:
      HYPOTHETICAL NOTE CONTENTS.

      For example:
      ["History > Ancient Civilizations > Egypt.md > Government > Pharaohs: The pharaohs of ancient Egypt were considered living gods and ruled with absolute power. They were responsible for maintaining order (ma'at) in society and acted as intermediaries between the gods and people. Notable pharaohs included Ramesses II who ruled for 66 years and built many monuments.",

ReLU is most popular due to reduced vanishing gradient problems. Sigmoid is useful for binary classification output layers. Consider using LeakyReLU or ELU to prevent dying neurons."]
