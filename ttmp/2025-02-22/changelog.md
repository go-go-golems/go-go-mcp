# Improved SSE Implementation for htmx

Updated the SSE implementation to properly support the htmx SSE extension API. This ensures that UI components can be updated in real-time through server-sent events.

- Added component rendering capability to the SSE handler
- Implemented proper event formatting according to htmx SSE extension requirements
- Added support for different event types (component-update, page-reload, yaml-update)
- Added ping events to keep connections alive
- Registered component renderers in the server
- Enhanced page-reload events to also send a full page update for seamless refreshes
