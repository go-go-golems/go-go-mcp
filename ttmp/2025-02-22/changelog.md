# Improved SSE Implementation for htmx

Updated the SSE implementation to properly support the htmx SSE extension API. This ensures that UI components can be updated in real-time through server-sent events.

- Added component rendering capability to the SSE handler
- Implemented proper event formatting according to htmx SSE extension requirements
- Added support for different event types (component-update, page-reload, yaml-update)
- Added ping events to keep connections alive
- Registered component renderers in the server
- Enhanced page-reload events to also send a full page update for seamless refreshes
- Optimized page reload by extracting page content into a separate template to avoid re-rendering the base template 

# Enhanced Page Reload Events with Page Definitions

Improved the page reload event system to include the full page definition in the event payload.

- Modified `NewPageReloadEvent` to accept and include the page definition
- Updated server code to pass the current page definition when publishing reload events
- This ensures that the SSE handler always has access to the most up-to-date page data
- Improves reliability of page content updates during reload events
